### About
`SPPermissions` is an API to ask for user permissions using Swift. The API provides for three UI options (list, dialog & native). 

The UI/UX is in an **Apple style** and supports iPad, dark mode, & tvOS. 

Also you can check the state permissions using the API.

If you like the project, don't forget to `put star ★` and follow me on GitHub:

## Requirements

Swift `4.2` & `5.0`. Ready for use on iOS 11+

## Installation

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `SPPermissions` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Notification'
```

Due to Apple's new policy regarding permission access you need to specifically define what kind of permissions you want to access using subspecs. For example if you want to access `Camera`, `Location` & `Microphone` you define the following:

```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Camera'
pod 'SPPermissions/Location'
pod 'SPPermissions/Microphone'
```

<details><summary>Available subspecs</summary>
<p>

```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Camera'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Contacts'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Calendar'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/PhotoLibrary'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Notification'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Microphone'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Reminders'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/SpeechRecognizer'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Location'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Motion'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/MediaLibrary'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Bluetooth'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Tracking'
```

</p>
</details>

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate `SPPermissions` into your Xcode project using Xcode 11, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add`:

```ogdl
https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions
```

After integrate need add configuration. See example [SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions/blob/master/Source/Supporting%20Files/SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig) file or example project. If you don't know how add configuration file, see this [short video](https://youtu.be/1kR5HGVhJfk).

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate `SPPermissions` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "ivanvorobei/SPPermissions"
```

By default available all permissions. You can provide custom build flags _before_ building the dynamic framework to only compile
with permissions you request. Open file [SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions/blob/master/Source/Supporting%20Files/SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig) in `Source/SPPermissions/Supporting Files`, comment unusable permissions and rebuild:

```ruby
carthage build
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `SPPermissions` into your project manually. Put `Source/SPPermissions` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

After it need add configuration. See example [SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions/blob/master/Source/SPPermissions/Supporting%20Files/SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig) file or example project. If you don't know how add configuration file, see this [short video](https://youtu.be/1kR5HGVhJfk).

## Usage

This project had separate modules for the display UI options. The interfaces are: `Dialog`, `List` and `Native`. Each interface has delegates and a datasource. If you want see an example app, open `SPPermissions.xcodeproj` and choose the `Example` target. 

### Dialog

This is a Modal alert, which was used in the previous version (<5.x). I recomend the use of this alert style when your requested permissions are less than three. Usage example:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.dialog([.camera, .photoLibrary])

// Ovveride texts in controller
controller.titleText = "Title Text"
controller.headerText = "Header Text"
controller.footerText = "Footer Text"

// Set `DataSource` or `Delegate` if need. 
// By default using project texts and icons.
controller.dataSource = self
controller.delegate = self

// Always use this method for present
controller.present(on: self)
```

### List

Native `UITableViewController` with support for the iPad. Use it with more than two permissions. An example of how it is used:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.list([.calendar, .camera, .contacts])

// Ovveride texts in controller
controller.titleText = "Title Text"
controller.headerText = "Header Text"
controller.footerText = "Footer Text"

// Set `DataSource` or `Delegate` if need. 
// By default using project texts and icons.
controller.dataSource = self
controller.delegate = self

// Always use this method for present
controller.present(on: self)
```

### Native

Request permissions with native alerts. You can request many permissions at once:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.native([.calendar, .camera, .contacts])

// Set `Delegate` if need. 
controller.delegate = self

// Always use this method for request. 
// You can pass any controller, this request because need implement base protocol.
controller.present(on: self)
```

</p>

To check the state of any permission, call enum `SPPermission`: 

```swift
let state = SPPermission.calendar.isAuthorized
```

Also available is the func `isDenied`. This returns false if the permission has not been requested before.

## DataSource & Delegate

For a customized permssions view, implement `SPPermissionsDataSource`:

```swift
func configure(_ cell: SPPermissionTableViewCell, for permission: SPPermission) -> SPPermissionTableViewCell {
    return cell
}
```

Using a delegate, you can customize texts, colors, and icons. For a default view configure with the default values. After configuration return the cell.

You can customize:

```swift
// Titles
cell.permissionTitleLabel.text = "Notifications"
cell.permissionDescriptionLabel.text = "Remind about payment to your bank"
cell.button.allowTitle = "Allow"
cell.button.allowedTitle = "Allowed"

// Colors
cell.iconView.color = .systemBlue
cell.button.allowedBackgroundColor = .systemBlue
cell.button.allowTitleColor = .systemBlue

// If you want set custom image.
cell.set(UIImage(named: "IMAGE-NAME")!)
```

### Delegate

In the delegate you can implement these methods: 

```swift
// Events
func didAllow(permission: SPPermission) {}
func didDenied(permission: SPPermission) {}
func didHide(permissions ids: [Int])

// Denied alert. Show alert if permission denied.
func deniedData(for permission: SPPermission) -> SPPermissionDeniedAlertData?
```

You can detect permission values as follows:

```swift
let permissions = ids.map { SPPermission(rawValue: $0) }
```

### Denied alert

If you don't want show an alert if a permission is denied, return `nil` in the delegate. You can set the text in the alert: 

```swift
func deniedData(for permission: SPPermission) -> SPPermissionDeniedAlertData? {
    if permission == .notification {
        let data = SPPermissionDeniedAlertData()
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionTitle = "Permission denied"
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionDescription = "Please, go to Settings and allow permission."
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionButtonTitle = "Settings"
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionCancelTitle = "Cancel"
        return data
    } else {
        // If returned nil, alert will not show.
        return nil
    }
}
```

If you don't implement this method, the alert will appear with default text. To disable the alert you just need return `nil`.

## Good Practices

I recommend that you show the user all of the permission options, even if some of them are already allowed. But if you want to request only non-allowed permissions, use this code:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.list([.notification, .reminders].filter { !$0.isAuthorized } )
controller.present(on: self)
```

A good way to check for the need to show a dialog: check that all permissions are currently authorized by the user:

```swift
let permissions = [.notification, .reminders].filter { !$0.isAuthorized }
if permissions.isEmpty {
    // No need show dialog
} else {
    // Show dialog
}
```

If you request location services, you can show both `.locationWhenInUse` & `.locationAlwaysAndWhenInUse`. If the user allowed `always` mode, they can also change to `when in use` mode:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.dialog([.locationWhenInUse, .locationAlwaysAndWhenInUse])
controller.present(on: self)
```

## Keys in Info.plist

You need to add some keys to the `Info.plist` file with descriptions. List of keys:

- NSCameraUsageDescription
- NSContactsUsageDescription
- NSCalendarsUsageDescription
- NSMicrophoneUsageDescription
- NSAppleMusicUsageDescription
- NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription
- NSMotionUsageDescription
- NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
- NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
- NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription (iOS 10 and earlier)
- NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription
- NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription (iOS 12 and earlier)
- NSUserTrackingUsageDescription

Do not use the description as the name of the key.

### Localization keys

If you use xliff localization export, keys will be create automatically. If you prefer do the localization file manually, you need to create `InfoPlist.strings`, select languages in the right side menu and add keys as keys in plist-file. See:

```
"NSCameraUsageDescription" = "Here description of usage camera";
```

## Design of previous version

I developed `SPPermissions` in an 'Apple-way'. To accomplish this, I checked 30 apps to get UI-elements for this project. I then took screenshots and re-drew the elements in Sketch. For example, the project's `Allow` button is similar to the `Get` button in the AppStore. Check this [timelapse](https://youtu.be/1mDdX7fQRv4) to see how I designed the `4.0` version of  `SPPermissions`:

## Other Projects

#### [SPAlert](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPAlert)
It is popup from Apple Music & Feedback in AppStore. Contains Done & Heart presets. Done present with draw path animation. I clone Apple's alerts as much as possible.
You can find this alerts in AppStore after feedback, after added song to library in Apple Music. I am also add alert without icon, as simple message.

#### [SPDiffable](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPDiffable)
Apple's diffable API requerid models for each object type. If you want use it in many place, you pass many time to implemenet and get over duplicates codes. This project help you do it elegant with shared models and special cell providers for one-usage models.
